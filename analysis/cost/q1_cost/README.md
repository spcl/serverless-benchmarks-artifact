The Jupyter notebook `plots.ipynb` contains the Python code that generates Figures 5a, 5b
in the paper.

In addition to `cost_two_plots.pdf` and `cost_efficiency.pdf` files, it generates `.csv`
files with raw data.

Source of data: `data/performance/{provider}_perf_cost`, where `provider` is `aws`, `azure`, or `gcp.
